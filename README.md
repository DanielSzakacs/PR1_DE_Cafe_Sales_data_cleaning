# Cafe Sales â€“ Dirty Data Cleaning Project

### - Data Source

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [Kaggle: Cafe Sales - Dirty Data for Cleaning Training](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training)

### - About the Dataset

This dataset contains 10,000 rows of synthetic cafe sales transactions. It was intentionally designed to be "dirty" â€” with missing values, inconsistent formatting, and data quality issues â€” to simulate real-world data cleaning challenges. It provides an ideal use case for practicing data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering techniques.

### - Project Goal

The dataset is not analysis-ready. The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning and transformation to make the dataset suitable for further analysis. Key tasks include:

- Replacing invalid string values (e.g., `"error"`, `"unknown"`, `"nan"`) with proper missing value indicators (`NaN`)
- Handling missing values appropriately
- Cleaning textual data (e.g., removing extra characters, standardizing values)
- Parsing and transforming date-related columns into structured features
- Converting column data types to appropriate formats
